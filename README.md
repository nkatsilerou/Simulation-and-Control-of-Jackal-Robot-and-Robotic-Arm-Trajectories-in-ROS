Designed and implemented motion control algorithms for the Jackal differential drive robot and a two-joint robotic arm using ROS and Gazebo. For the Jackal robot, planned and executed trajectories through linear and angular velocity commands, utilizing cubic polynomials and linear functions for smooth motion transitions. For the robotic arm, generated joint-specific trajectory paths, ensuring motion compliance with predefined angular velocity limits. Tested and validated the systems through custom ROS nodes, leveraging simulation tools to ensure accurate motion control and trajectory adherence.
